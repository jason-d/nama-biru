274	Warewolf	Newcastle Federation	Edinburgh	Scotland	4.50%	2		11/17/2013	Premium Bitter/ESB	What better way to toast the fall than to have a bottle of this formidable, dual character brew. At first smooth with mellow overtones of sweet berry fruit, a bite of bitterness suddenly cuts through, long, deep and lingering. Brewed with Rye Malt, it is naturally blood red in colour. Unlike the mythical wolf-like creature said to roam the bleak moorland surrounding Newcastle, this is real, so consider yourself warned!
275	OctoberfFish	Flying Fish	New Jersey	USA	6.00%	3	3	11/20/2013	Altbier	A tribute to the classic Fest styles of Germany the O’Fish uses European malts hops and yeast. A beautiful reddish color, a savory malt profile and nice hop flavor, make this Fest beer quite drinkable. OktoberFish is great with food and especially great with Lederhosen.

277	Narwhal	Sierra Nevada	California	USA	10.20%	4	5	11/27/2013	Imperial Stout	This malt-forward monster is bold – with notes of baker’s cocoa, molasses, and dark roasted coffee. This massive imperial stout is incredibly complex, rich, and intense and will develop in the bottle for years to come.
278	The Great Impression Stock Ale	Dust Bowl	California	USA	11.40%	4	4	11/29/2013	Old Ale	Stock ales are brewed at a higher gravity to hold up to extended aging. British hops take a back seat in this ale and provide subtle hop notes and just enough bitterness to support a malt showcase. While fresh, the beer presents with balancing bitterness, but is still dominated by the malt character. Over time, the bitterness subsides and new flavors are created during the aging process
279	Chocolate Porter	Hangar 24	California	USA	8.00%	3	3	11/29/2013	Imperial/Strong Porter	Rich and decadent. This strong porter is perfect for sipping at the end of the day or to accompany full-flavored foods. The intense, roasty flavor comes from two types of chocolate malt and raw cocoa nibs. Whole vanilla beans introduced post fermentation add complexity and enhance the dessert-like qualities of this full bodied beer. Indulge yourself!
280	Wee Heavy	Belhaven	East Lothian	Scotland	6.50%	3	2	11/29/2013	Scotch Ale	Belhaven Wee Heavy has a rich deep flavor. A beer to be sipped, savoured and fully respected.
281	Big Daddy IPA	Speakeasy Ales & Lagers	California	USA	6.50%	3	2	12/7/2013	India Pale Ale	No lightweight, Big Daddy I.P.A. tips the scales with a huge hop flavor and a dry, clean finish that leaves the scene without a trace.
